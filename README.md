# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Our project's purpose is to assign the user a basketball position they would most likely fit based on their favorite NBA player. Our code analyzes a text file we created ourselves filled with popular NBA players from past and present. We also include their position in order to determine which position the user should play based on their favorite player. 

## NLP Techniques

The NLP technique we used in our project was the chat bot NLP. In order to implement a chat bot, we used methods such as a scanner method and isInList method. The isInList method checks if the user's input is in the text files. Then the scanner method will give a response based on the user's input if that is in the text files.
